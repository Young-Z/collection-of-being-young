    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Maybe God is a super high dimensional substance. Indeed he created us as himself,\n",
    "  but in a 3D space, just like what happens for a 4D hyper cube, project in 3D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./resources/4d-hypercube.jpg\" width=\"350\">\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Transcendental numbers, I think irrational attribute of these numbers makes one of finest creation by God. Why?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.Testify God's creation is perfect. God provides functions to prove the existance of these numbers like pi, e, so we can find and understand the natrual laws created upon these numbers.\n",
    "    2.Authenticate us to use these numbers with imperfection. Since God provides us methods to approximate the values for these numbers, we can leverage the laws to beautify our life.\n",
    "    3.Authority Control. Since it is infinite to us. we would never be as good as God. we can only have approximate of these numbers that good enough to serve our life, but never get the exect value to rule the creation over God's control.\n",
