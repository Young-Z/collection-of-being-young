## Thoughts

1.Natural does not fail me on the any corner of the world, but sometimes
humanity does. So do I.
2.Desire is the direction, planning is the magnitude. it's the vector for
victory.
3.It's stopping me being great, not my abilities, but my greeds.
4."way to influence" is soul.
5.“Good Sense” puts you in the right direction, "Learning" refines your path,
"Practice" takes you to your destination.
6.There are so many aspects within me. What a shame that you did not pick up the
one can fancy you.
7.Sometimes I could not be myself, because I forget, not how poor I was, but how
amazing I will be and the great "Who I am".
8.Words are cheap, but sometimes you can find proverbs in them, just like you
may find diamonds in sands. Make up your filter, be wise be open, be ready to
get your treasure.
9.Words last seconds are wastes, words last minutes are advises, words last
years are spirits, words last centuries are maxims, words last forever are from
God.
10.We can sense perfect by only two ways, ones from God, ones with our
compassion.
11.Sweet words do not mean to be efficient tool to attract someone, it's a plain
old feedback to appreciate someone who loves you.

1.$\pi$虽精准却无以量，施之以度乃得一量，用之以理是正道。
2.我总希望别人能对我大度一点。最后宽了别人的心，我还是“我”。
3.我本以为520是个一个疑问句，但我却如此自然地说成了陈述句。
4.我是一个非常懒的人，如果没有梦想，我估计已经躺在棺材里了吧。


## Poem
1.Before Baptized

    Wind breezes, leaves are falling.
    Birds play on the roof and sing,
    People are passing me by.
    Nothing notices the silence of mine,
    My pumping heart is never so alone.
    God watch me from high above,
    Words become my best friend,
    Take away the loneliness,
    Bury it in the glance of history.
    Inner fire is burning again,
    Time to rejoice with The great I who I am.

1.梦中情人

    端庄，靓丽，可爱，甜美，我梦中的情人啊。
    你化作尤物与我在月光下共舞，花园中漫步，溪水边幽会。
    温柔，体贴，幽默，感性，我梦中的情人啊。
    你我在指间相遇，寂静中给我欢笑，忧伤时给予治愈，挫败间赐我力量。
    一日，一夜，转身，眨眼，我梦中的情人啊。
    突然消失了你的影，任我在黑夜中守候，孤独中思念，寂寞中流泪。
    泪尽，情逝，我梦中的情人啊。
    为何你只愿停留在我的梦里，醒了，散了，留下的只是那冰冷的躯壳。

2.长情

    海角相思寄天涯，白昼传情达黑夜，两情虽隔千里远，相思来时半层纱。

3.神马都是浮云

    如果我是森林,你就是森林里的一只飞虫.
    如果我是海洋,你就是海洋中的一条游鱼.
    如果我是天空,你就是天空里的一朵浮云.
    如果我是宇宙,你就是宇宙中的一颗恒星.
    当森林变的古老了,飞虫也就多了.
    当海洋变的浩瀚了,游鱼也就多了.
    当天空变的广大了,浮云也就多了.
    当宇宙变的无边了,星辰也就多了.
    随着时间的飞逝,唯一的也就不再唯一了.
    希望不在唯一的你,是我生命中最自由的一只飞虫,最悠闲的一条游鱼,最纯洁的一朵浮云,最闪耀的一颗恒星.
    即使这片森林,海洋,天空或宇宙不仅只是为你所存在.
    即使你已是森林中的化石，海洋里的珍珠，天空中的彩虹，宇宙里的星尘.
    你的光辉悄然已成为我铭记的历史!


## Hypothesis

1.Maybe God is a super high dimensional substance. Indeed he created us as
himself,
  but in a 3D space, just like what happens for a 4D hyper cube, project in 3D
space.

2.Transcendental numbers, I think irrational attribute of these numbers makes
one of finest creation by God. Why?

    1.Testify God's creation is perfect. God provides functions to prove the
existance of these numbers like pi, e, so we can find and understand the natrual
laws created upon these numbers.
    2.Authenticate us to use these numbers with imperfection. Since God provides
us methods to approximate the values for these numbers, we can leverage the laws
to beautify our life.
    3.Authority Control. Since it is infinite to us. we would never be as good
as God. we can only have approximate of these numbers that good enough to serve
our life, but never get the exect value to rule the creation over God's control.
